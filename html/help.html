    <h4>Quick Start</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a collection</li>
      <li>Add a primary key (optional) and other required keys</li>
      <li>Start adding data as necessary</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>QuickDB leverages the power of Index DB that comes with most modern browsers</li>
      <li>All your data is secure, since there is no server interaction besides site loading</li>
      <li>This means that not only is your data private, but the whole system works fully offline</li>
      <li>However, YOU are in charge of backing up your data regularly and keeping it safe</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Backup and Restore</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Simply click "Backup" option for corresponding collection</li>
      <li>It will download a compressed file on your local machine</li>
      <li>You may save this file either on cloud or on external storage as necessary</li>
      <li>To restore, simply click "Restore" and upload the above file</li>
    </ul>
